### EE456 Assignments - PSU Fall 2023

This repository contains coding assignments completed during the Fall 2023 semester in the Penn State University course EE 456 - Neural Networks

## EE456 Final Project

- Used Vision Transformer (ViT) to classify logos from Kaggle Logos Dataset (images of variable quality, focus, and orientation, 6 classes of logos, ~2300 images in dataset with ~75/25 train/test split)
- Cross Entropy Loss Function, Adam optimizer, Dropout Regularization, trained in batches of 96
- Achieved 92% validation and 95% test accuracy despite using ViT with such a small dataset
- Folder contains dataset, train.py, test.py, and hyperparameter.py files, separated train, test, and hyperparameter files for convenience
